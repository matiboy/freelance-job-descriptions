Ionic2 Tablet Application Modifying
===================================

Description
-----------

We are looking for an engineer with skills in Angular2/Ionic2 to take over a fully functional mobile application, and make amendments to it.
The first step will be for you to ensure you can build the appliation for Android only and be able to upload it to AppCenter. Minor changes will be expected on one of the 8 pages of the application.
In the second phase, an estimated 20 hours of features/amendments is expected to be required. We can commit to these 20 hours as soon as phase 1 confirms the skills required.

The app is only used on one size of tablet, very little consideration needs to be given to compatibility outside of that tablet model.

Technologies
------------

- Ionic2 with Bootstrap
- Angular2
- Simple HTTP calls to an existing API
- Markup and CSS changes are minor - no designer skills are expected

Deliverables
------------

The source code of the existing project will be provided, you will be working on a branch from it. The source code will always need to be part of the delivery.
For phase 1, delivery is additionally an Android build successfully downloadable from our AppCenter, with very minor amendments to the existing application.
For phase 2, requirements will be given as they are passed on by the client. Each time, a build will be needed in the AppCenter.
